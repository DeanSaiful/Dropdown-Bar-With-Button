# Dropdown-Bar-With-Button

This is a simple HTML and JavaScript code snippet that creates a dropdown menu for frontend developer skills and displays their respective skill levels using progress bars.

## How it works
When you click on the "Frontend Developer" or "Dropdown" button, a dropdown menu will appear, displaying three frontend skills (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) along with their respective skill levels represented by progress bars.

## Usage
1. Open the provided HTML code in a web browser.
2. Click on the "Frontend Developer" or "Dropdown" button to reveal the dropdown menu.
3. The dropdown menu will show three frontend skills, each with its skill level represented by a progress bar.

## Code Explanation
The code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to achieve the dropdown functionality and progress bar display.

### HTML Structure
- Two dropdown buttons are created, one for "Frontend Developer" and another for "Dropdown."
- Each dropdown button has a corresponding dropdown container, which contains skill information and progress bars.

### CSS Styling
- The styling provides a simple layout for the dropdown and progress bars.
- The dropdown container is hidden by default and becomes visible when the corresponding button is clicked.
- The progress bars represent the skill levels for each frontend skill.

### JavaScript Functionality
- JavaScript is used to handle the dropdown's opening and closing behavior.
- The `toggleDropdown` function toggles the visibility of the dropdown container when a button is clicked.
- The `closeOtherDropdowns` function ensures that only one dropdown is open at a time and closes others when a new one is clicked.

## Customization
You can customize this code by changing the skills and their respective skill levels in the HTML section. You can also modify the CSS to match your preferred styling.

## Dependencies
- This code snippet uses the Font Awesome icon library for the dropdown icon.

## Compatibility
This code is compatible with modern web browsers that support HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.

Feel free to use this code in your projects, modify it according to your needs, and have fun building great frontend experiences!
